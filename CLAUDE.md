## gstack

This project uses [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) for AI-assisted
workflows. Verify it's installed before relying on any skill below:

```bash
test -d ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin && echo "GSTACK_OK" || echo "GSTACK_MISSING"
```

If `GSTACK_MISSING`, install it (requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.0+ — install
with `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash` first if `bun --version` fails):

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack
cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup
```

On a Linux distro Playwright doesn't officially recognize yet (its browser
install fails with `Playwright does not support chromium on <distro>-x64`),
`/browse` and other browser-driving skills need one more step — a same-family
fallback build still works (confirmed working on Ubuntu 26.04 with the
ubuntu24.04 fallback):

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse
PLAYWRIGHT_HOST_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE=ubuntu24.04-x64 bunx playwright install chromium chromium-headless-shell
```

- Use the `/browse` skill from gstack for **all** web browsing.
- **Never** use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.
- Run `/setup-gbrain` once in this repository to initialize the project brain.
